## Source code for my old jekyll site that was running at jvikraman.com

### There's nothing fancy in here...just a normal jekyll site created using the `minima` theme with certain customizations. The site's actually running on `jvikraman.github.io` with a redirect pointing to a custom domain `jvikraman.com`
