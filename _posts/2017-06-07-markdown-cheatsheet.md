When writing content using markdown, I often forget about the syntax in general & the nuances of the language. So I did myself a favor and created a customized markdown cheatsheet over at Github.

Since I already have that in a github repo - why duplicate it here.

Here's the link to the repo -> [Markdown Cheatsheet](https://github.com/jvikraman/markdown-cheatsheet)

Enjoy :)
