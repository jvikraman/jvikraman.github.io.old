Hi I 'm Jegadeesh - a software engineer working primarily on web technologies that includes but not limited to HTML, CSS and JavaScript. My current focus is on web application development using React.js

I 've also played a variety of roles (for e.g. Sr. Engineer, Solution Lead, Business Consultant etc.) in my past engagements and worked with technologies like IBM Notes & Domino, Angular, SharePoint, .NET, Java etc.

I maintain this site to document things related to software development and my encounters and fair share of battles with `code` - who wouldn't like a sticky note on the cloud :)
