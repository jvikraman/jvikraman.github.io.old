Hi I 'm Jegadeesh Vikramanthampi - a software engineer working primarily on web technologies that includes but not limited to HTML, CSS and JavaScript. In my latest role, I 'm an UI Engineer working on a royalty management platform for a consumer electronics giant based out of California. My current focus is on web application development using Node.js, CanJS and React.js

I 've also had the opportunity to play a variety of roles in my past engagements for e.g. Sr. Engineer, Solution Lead, Business Consultant etc. and had the privilege to work with technologies like IBM Notes & Domino, Angular, SharePoint, .NET, Java etc.

I maintain this site to document things related to software development and my encounters and fair share of battles with `code` - who wouldn't like a sticky note on the cloud :)
