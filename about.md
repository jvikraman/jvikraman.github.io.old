Hi I 'm Jegadeesh Vikraman - a software engineer working primarily on web technologies that includes but not limited to IBM Notes & Domino, Javascript, Angular, React, Node, SharePoint, .NET etc.

I 'm currently working for a fintech major based out of the dairy land (you guessed it right - Wisconsin) I maintain this blog mainly to document things related to software development.
